SolidusCountriesBackend
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/solidusio-contrib/solidus_countries_backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/solidusio-contrib/solidus_countries_backend)

**WIP**: This extension is not ready yet. Do not use it until the pull
request below has been merged.

Add an admin UI to Solidus for managing countries and states.

This functionality has been removed from Solidus core with
[#2118](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2118).

Important Note
--------------

Solidus will remove support for changing countries and states since they
will not be stored anymore in the database. Solidus will slowly migrate to [Carmen](https://github.com/jim/carmen) and this is part of the
migration process so **it is recommended not to use this extension**.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_countries_backend to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_countries_backend'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_countries_backend:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_countries_backend/factories'
```
